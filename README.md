Galvanize Quarter One Project: The Last Flame Templar

Summer 2021 Update: I've gone through and cleaned up some of the code formating and client-facing page so that the user experience is better. To preserve the "authenticity" of this project (it being my first), I've left many other things untouched (variables are still created with 'var' instead of 'let' or 'const', using 'prototype' instead of ES2015 classes, etc.) While code is meant to be iterative and improved upon, I've decided that I would like this project to remain mostly the same, with minor improvements for a better user experience.
